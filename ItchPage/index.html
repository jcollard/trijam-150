<h2>Group 'Em</h2>
<h3>A Variation on the Card Game Set</h3>
<p>Group 'Em is a puzzle solitaire game where you must find three cards which
make up a group.</p>
<h3>What is a Group?</h3>
<p>Each card has 4 properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Color: Red, Blue, or Green</li>
    <li>A Value: One, Two, or Three</li>
    <li>A Shade: Light, Dark, or Empty</li>
    <li>A Shape: Circle, Triangle, or Square</li>
</ul>
<p>Three cards is said to be a group if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All colors match or differ</li>
    <li>All values match or differ</li>
    <li>All shades match or differ</li>
    <li>All shapes match or differ</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, each property of the three cards must match or differ from each
other.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>

**EXAMPLE 1**

<p>The above example meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All colors differ</li>
    <li>All values match</li>
    <li>All shades match</li>
    <li>All shapes differ</li>
</ul>

**EXAMPLE 2**

<p>The above example meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All colors match</li>
    <li>All values match</li>
    <li>All shades differ</li>
    <li>All shapes differ</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>It is rare that among 12 cards you will not be able to find a group. However,
if you are stuck, there is a Hint feature built into the game. By selecting 2
cards on the board, it will tell you which card is required to complete the set.
This can be very useful when you're first learning to game.

<h3>Discarding 3 Cards</h3>
<p>If you find yourself completely stuck, or just tired of the current cards,
you can discard 3 cards at random from the board and replace them with cards
from the deck.

<h3>Challenge to Get 27 Groups</h3>
<p>
    Although there is no way to lose the game, it is possible to complete a full
    27 groups. This requires a great amount of planning and luck. Can you finish
    the deck without discarding any cards? Good luck!

    This is my submission to Trijam #150. The theme was "Grouping". The goal is
    to create a game in 3 hours. My final development time was 2:55. I hope you
    enjoy this game.
